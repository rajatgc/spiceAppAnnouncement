            In our constant endeavour to provide you with the most advanced
            platform for online learning, we would like to announce the launch
            of SpiceLearn 3.0, the new and upgraded version of your favourite
            learning App.
          </p>
          <p class="para para-2">
            One of the most important features of this upgraded App is the
            Instructor-led training section, which can now be accessed directly
            from the home page of the SpiceLearn App; this is another step to
            make learning seamless and consistent, with the introduction of this
            feature all offline or online Instructor-led training sessions can
            now be accessed through the ILT section on the home screen
            (available under the library section). Additionally, we have also
            optimized the App for faster and much more stable performance.
          </p>
          <p class="para para-3">

            update the Spicelearn App; please use the forgot password link in
